# Home Vision Project Readme

Welcome to Home Vision ‚Äì Your Ultimate 3D House Visualization Tool! üè°üîç

## Description
Home Vision is a comprehensive project that allows you to visualize houses in 3D, providing an interactive experience to explore different blueprints and models. The project is divided into four main categories: Web, Blueprint, App, and ML Model.

### Web

The Web component is developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. To get started, simply clone the repository and run `npm i`. After installation, launch the application with `npm start`. Explore the web interface to interact with 3D house models and select blueprints.

### Blueprint

In the Blueprint category, you can choose from various blueprints for your house. The user-friendly web interface allows you to preview and select the blueprint that suits your preferences.

### App

The App component, built with React Native, offers a mobile solution for visualizing houses. Navigate to the app folder, run `npm i` for installation, and then start the app using `npm start`. Enjoy a seamless mobile experience with 3D house visualization.

### ML Model

For the ML Model, open the provided code in PyCharm and run it directly. This component enhances the project with advanced machine learning features, providing a deeper understanding of the house visualization process.
